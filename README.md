How to use:

1.Python 2.7
2.Run the unit tests coverage run -m unittest discover test or the full scenario python test.py

Specifications:

-Write a backend library for auction house for their online auction system.

-The system supports the following operations:
1. Auctioneer adds an item that can be auctioned. An item has a unique name and reserved price.
2. Auctioneer starts an auction on an item
3. Participants submit bids to an auction, a new bid has to have a price higher than the current highest bid otherwise it's not allowed.
4. Auctioneer calls the auction (when s/he makes the judgement on her own that there will be no more higher bids coming in). If the current highest bid is higher than the reserved price of the item, the auction is deemed as a success otherwise it's marked as failure. The item sold should be no longer available for future auctions.
5. Participant/Auctioneer queries the latest action of an item by item name. The library should return the status of the auction if there is any, if the item is sold, it should return the information regarding the price sold and to whom it was sold to.
